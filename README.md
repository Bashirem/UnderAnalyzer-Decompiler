# UnderAnalyzer Decompiler
This is a Fork of the UnderAnalyzer Branch of UnderTaleModTool, that aims to bring the absolute Best Decompiling Experience for GameMaker Studio Games

And I mean TRUE Decompiling (and NOT just patching a game)

As in you can literally make a GameMaker Studio 2 or 1 Project from a Compiled Game


# Downloads

Only the GUI versions will be Included

As only GUI builds can use these new Decompiling Scripts

# Main Features and Changes

Features Include:
- A build that has UTMT's convenient UI, but with the benefits of the more accurate UnderAnalyzer Decompiler
- Decompiling Scripts are Included, so turn any GMS1 or 2 Game back into a GMS Project
- New Tab solely for Decompiling Scripts
- "Create Enum Declarations" Settings is now DISABLED by default, as that WILL fuck up a Decompilation
- Frequent Decompiler Updates to the Latest UnderAnalyzer Version
- Smaller file and project size, since unused libraries have been removed
- Game Info is also available on the Big Info Box when a Game has been Loaded, but when no asset is being looked at

- (NEW) Added Support for decompiling Pizza Tower's Player and Particle Enums (thanks to UTMTCE's Enum code)
- (NEW) Added Variable Definition Maker, so you can Define what variables use what asset types

Changes:
- Changed GUI to reflect the fact that this is a Decompiler, not a game patcher

# Included Scripts

All Scripts from UTMT are also included, but the new Scripts are:

- GameMaker Studio 2 Decompiler Script
- GameMaker Studio 1 Decompiler Script

> Miscellanous Scripts

- Export2YYMPS
- BetterExportAssetOrder
