# UnderAnalyzer Decompiler
THis is a Fork of the UnderAnalyzer Branch of UnderTaleModTool, that aims to bring the absolute Best Decompiling Expeirence for GameMaker Studio Games

And I mean TRUE Decompiling (and NOT just patching a game)

As in you can literally make a GameMaker Studio 2 or 1 Project from a Compiled Game

# Downloads

Only the GUI versions will be Included

As only GUI builds can use these new Decompiling Scripts

# Main Features and Changes

Features Include:
- Decompiling Scripts are now Included, so turn any GMS1 or 2 Game back into a GMS Project
- New Tab solely for Decompiling Scripts
- "Create Enum Declarations" Settings is now DISABLED by default, as that WILL fuck up a Decompilation

Changes:
- Removed ability to run a Temp Game, as that doesn't work with UA, and patching games isn't the point of this Fork
- Changed GUI text to reflect the fact that this is a Decompiler, not a game patcher

# Included Scripts

All Scripts from UTMT are also included, but the new Scripts are:

- GameMaker Studio 2 Decompiler Script
- GameMaker Studio 1 Decompiler Script
- BetterExportGMS2Enums

> Miscellanous Scripts

- BetterExportAssetOrder
