## UnderAnalyzer Decompiler

This Fork of UnderTaleModTool allows for Complete Decompilation of a given GameMaker Game
<br>
And I mean TRUE Decompiling (and NOT just patching a game)
<br>
As in you can literally make a GameMaker Studio 2 or 1 Project from a Compiled Game

## Downloads

Only the GUI versions will be Included
<br>
As only GUI builds can use these new Decompiling Scripts

## Main Features and Changes

Features Include:
- A build that has Improved the UTMT UI, and with the benefits of the more accurate UnderAnalyzer Decompiler
- Included Decompiling Scripts, so you can turn any GMS1 or 2 Game back into a GameMaker Project File (YYP for GMS2 or GMX for GMS1), or a GameMaker Importable Package (YYMPS)
- New Tab solely for Decompiling Scripts
- "Create Enum Declarations" Settings is now DISABLED by default, as that WILL fuck up a Decompilation
- Frequent Decompiler Updates to the Latest UnderAnalyzer Version
- Smaller file and project size, since unused libraries have been removed

- (NEW) Added Support for decompiling Pizza Tower's Player and Particle Enums (thanks partially to UTMTCE)
- (NEW) Added Variable Definition Maker, so you can Define what variables use what asset types

Changes:
- Changed GUI to reflect the fact that this is a Decompiler, not a game patcher

## Included Scripts

All Scripts from UTMT are also included, but the new Scripts are:

- GameMaker Studio 2 Decompiler Script
- GameMaker Studio 1 Decompiler Script
